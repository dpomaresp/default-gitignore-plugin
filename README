1. Test/Debug the plugin locally:
    To run a Bitbucket local server with the plugin already added and in debug mode:
        - atlas-debug
    Once the server is running you can redeploy the changes you have done to the plugin:
        - 1. atlas-cli
	    - 2. pi

2. Install the plugin
    Create a private/public pair ssh keys: ssh-keygen -C <admin_email>
    Go to "Administration" (top right corner)
        1. Go to "Users" and add the public ssh key to the 'admin' user
        2. Drop the private key somewhere in the bitbucket host machine and you will refer to it later in the configuration
        3. Go to "Manage add-ons" within "Administration", click "Upload add-on" and look for the jar file for this plugin
        4. Configure the plugin
        5. Disable the plugin for the projects where you don't want to use the default .gitignore (under project configuration).
            Also keep in mind when forking a repository, the default .gitignore won't be added to the forked repository.

    Once everything is done, the repositories created under a project which has the default .gitignore plugin enabled will have
    the default .gitignore
